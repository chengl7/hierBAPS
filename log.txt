18.03.2012 A bug was solved. c.data was not updated in the previous codes, thus the results are wrong when there appears minus labels.
20.03.2012 Adjust partition array function added. Now we can show the snp data matrix in a sorted order so that the final image looks clean.
18.04.2012 SNP data are stored in "uint8", also some variable are stored in "unit16" to save memory.
29.10.2012 drawSnpMat.m is updated, now also accept hierarchical partition as input, the visualization is much better now
29.10.2012 readFasta.m is added to quickly read fasta files
05.12.2012 modified for release purpose
22.03.2013 a bug in drawSnpMat fixed
09.08.2013 A site with at least two bases of "ACGT" is identified as SNP site. The prior for bases in a site depends on available SNPs, e.g. (0.5, 0.5, 0, 0) is used for a site with two variants "AC".
16.01.2015 Added the '-v7.3' flag to the save command
